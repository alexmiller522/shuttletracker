Contains solutions to common installation problems
## Go
- Make sure to try ('echo $GOPATH') to confirm that Go has been added to your system path, If it returns a blank line, it didn't work. In this case use ('sudo vim ~/.profile') press Capslock and then G to navigate to the bottom of the file and add the lines ('export GOPATH=$HOME/work') and ('export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin'). Use Shift + ZZ to save and exit. Restart your command prompt and confirm that ('echo $GOPATH') now turns something.
  
 ## PostgreSQL
  -when you install, if it gives a message stating that it couldn't start the server use ('sudo service postgresql start') before trying to create the database
  -if when running ('createdb shuttletracker') you get an error about not being able to do this as root, follow theses steps to create a new linux super user: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-create-sudo-user-on-ubuntu
  -when changing the `postgres://user:password@localhost/shuttletracker?sslmode=disable` line in the conf file, you might be unsure of what the password is, in this case open postgresSQL using ('sudo -u postgres psql postgres') and then '(alter user postgres with password \'postgres\'')
  
  ## Node
-if you had to use n to get the correct version of Nodejs and get an error along the lines of `Node Sass could not find a binding for your current environment:` while trying to run 'npx vue-cli-service build --mode development' use ('npm rebuild node-sass') to correct it. This is likely to occur if you discovered the issue with Nodejs after running ('npm install')
-if when running ('npx vue-cli-service build --mode development') npx is an unknown command, it's because you have the wrong version of node installed. Follow the instructions on the readme for using n to corret this

## Npm
-issues here are likely due to an incorrect version of nodejs, so be sure to test that first
-Ignore the vulnerabilities ('npm install') warns you about, currently not all of the current versions of libraries function properly so ('npm fix') will break stuff 


If you need a fresh start ('sudo apt-get --purge remove PACKAGE_NAME') can be used to uninstall any of the above so that you can try the process again.
