I had to figure out how to add colored dots next to the names of the routes. I had to do a lot of research because I am not experienced in doing this. With this I have to go to the API and get the colors and then figure out the CSS and HTML for this

My idea is to make another column before the name and just add the dots there

I used this website for some inspiration on the dots.
